halo2-proofs contains the content of [0xParc class](https://learn.0xparc.org/halo2/) on halo2 as well
as my personal notes.

halo2-lib contains the fibonacci circuit implementation using the [aforementioned library](https://github.com/axiom-crypto/halo2-lib).  

Ultimately, if vertical gates of format q * (a + b * c - d) == 0 can be used, this shows that halo2-lib does a great job in hiding most of the circuit building complexity, at least for trivial exercises.
