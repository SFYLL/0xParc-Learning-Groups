# MIT-IAP-2023-Zero-Knowledge-Encryption

My notes and exercise submissions for [[MIT IAP 2023] Modern Zero Knowledge Cryptography](https://zkiap.com/#34e5b6cf6e1d4dd3901940d4be2edb0b).

I completed this course fully remotely and without a strong math background, so if you're doubting yourself, don't!
